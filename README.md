# MA678_midterm_project

This project is working on Airbnb dataset, trying to figure out the relationship between the price of listings and other possibly related predictors such as the location of the listings, the review scores value of listings, host information and etc. 

Report has not been formed yet so I added explanations of what I did below different headings. 

**My questions:**
1. What kind of validation for models can I make? I just made residual plots, did ANOVA for models and compated the AIC value. 
2. Do I need to make spatial multilevel models? As I did sptial kriging to the price and get the smoothed data for each Boston tract. If so, will the group in multilevel will be the Boston neighborhoods? (Any helpful materials can provided?) So far I have created multilevel model on the original data(based on each listing), without considering the spatial relationship.
