Also loves to grow vegetables, take note of nature, and enjoy sunsets as well as sunrises if I can get up early enough.
I cook a lot and have a small obsession with canning; jams, salsa, pickles, chutney... And have recently started fermenting!
A sourdough starter joined our family last fall and has been dubbed """"my baby"""" as it just eats, makes messes and lots of bubbles.

I am a wife to amazingly brilliant and handsome husband, and mom to """"the happiest kid on the block"""". We are an accepting family and love to interact with our neighbors as well as folks passing by, but we also have lives and expect that others do as well and like to believe we have the good sense to know when to give someone their space.
We've traveled to Slovenia, Uganda, Germany, Russia and Argentina as a couple.
We prefer to stay places where we can walk or ride a bike to.... Whatever there is to see and do.  If there is fresh water, we will swim in it, even if its glacier fed!

I love to enhance the guest  experience.  Perhaps that鈥檚 why I鈥檝e been a 鈥淪uper Host鈥<9d> for most of my 4 seasons hosting for Airbnb.  I also love my home.  It gives me great joy to share it with travelers from around the earth.  While confessing my longcomings, I am also a clean freak.  I won鈥檛 be underfoot while you are here, just in preparing for you.  Having an eclectic 1860s townhouse has me going into contortions cleaning out nooks and crannies that could pass the more casual eye.

Each year, with my earnings from Airbnb, I make updates and remodel rooms I get bored with.  2018  my kitchen was a DIY project that I am quite proud about.  I鈥檓 curious to get your opinion.  I let the professionals redo my dining room walls and ceilings removing wall paper and adding a beautiful  paint color from the historic collection.  Previous years had me update my very large shared bathroom.  Although shared, I never got any complaints about availability but praises on its lushness.  I hope I don鈥檛 jinx myself.  Every pipe and my heating system has been replaced, although not a fun expenditure, reliability has its value.  My seasonal backyard has more privacy and is a go to vacation spot in a hurry.

Since the large bathroom is shared, I try to compensate for the possible inconvenience by offering s free continental breakfast at your convenience, coffee and tea at any time with or without my famous home baked cookies. Bottled water is placed in your room along with lots of brochures on local favorites.

I also offer airport pickup/drop off for those travelers who want to hit the ground running.  I could take you back to get settled or drop you off at a destination.  When you arrive later, your luggage will be waiting for you in your room.  Fault me if you will but I have no interest in changing!  I also share my driveway for one vehicle.  Although there is free non-restricted parking on my street, late arrivals have the convenience of easy access for loading and unloading.  I do have two guest rooms so make sure you request the space in advance or the other guest or myself will be parked there.

I look forward to hosting you.  If you need privacy, you will get it.  If you are looking for interaction, you will get it.  I love doing both.

Can鈥檛 wait to meet you!!

A rich history is woven into the fabric of every street, so much so that one can feel a part of America's past, both distant and near.

I hope you find that place in the studio apartment in my home.  As a Peace Corps Volunteer I lived in Yalta, Ukraine, shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  That afforded me the opportunity to travel throughout Eastern Europe and Russia.  Since then I have worked in the Balkans, and have also traveled throughout Africa.  Currently I am focused on the trafficking of women and other aspects of modern day slavery, and am looking forward to new horizons.

One of the great things that I enjoy in Boston is it鈥檚 open space.  My home is located within several blocks of three of those great parks.  Another great treasure in the Boston area--and one of the reasons that I moved to Boston--is it鈥檚 location on the ocean, and the opportunity to sail.  You can go on whale watches, cruises around the harbor, or take the water taxi to visit Old Ironsides.  Boston also has wonderful museums and a great public transportation system to take you there.

I started on Airbnb with """"Gorgeous Cape Cod"""" property in May 2015, listed our renovated """"Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"""" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated """"Beautiful Boston Brownstone"""" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - """"Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 170 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

One final note on guest safety. As a SUPERHOST guest safety is one of our highest priorities. Behind the scenes, in preparation for your stay, we spend on average 5 hours cleaning & disinfecting our apartment for before check in vs. 30 minutes, the average time a hotel maid cleans a room. We use an estimated (2) 75 count Clorox wipes/green scent to disinfect the apartment ( as Clorox wipes are prioritized for hospitals we have switched to clorox and hydrogen peroxide) for each guest stay. If you would like more information regarding our extensive cleaning methodology, including details such as : entire repainting of the apartment each year, purchasing new linens, deep cleaning the couch and rugs, etc鈥lad to share it, just ask.

I started on Airbnb with """"Gorgeous Cape Cod"""" property in May 2015, listed our renovated """"Stunning South End Back Bay Penthouse"""" in August 2015, and listed our newly renovated """"Beautiful Boston Brownstone"""" in August 2016. We also just launched both Boston units together for larger parties - """"Luxury Brownstone Penthouse Duplex""""! 

I have been successfully renting the Cape Cod home for over 15 years and was a landlord before we converted to condos here in Boston 10 years prior to that.

I promise you I am extremely accommodating to all of my guests. I make sure everything is perfect on arrival and I am accessible whenever needed. In fact, we received Superhost status every single quarter since we began (we have more than 170 5 star reviews)!

Aside from hosting, I am an advertising executive in Boston, I am married to David, my partner in life and all things real estate and mother to our wonderful daughter, Adria, who is a senior at Northwestern University in Chicago.

I am enjoying meeting new and interesting people from around the world through Airbnb and making sure I provide the highest quality experience possible for all of my guests.

Thank you for taking the time to view my listings and hope to hear from you!

Warmest regards

Sue

My large family are all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

It's a safe, friendly and beautiful. There are grocery stores and take-out restaurants in walking distance. (10 minutes walking) Some nice restaurants are within 10 minutes of driving time. Nothing as fancy as downtown Boston though, ^^!<br /><br />We're a 2min walk from the Redline T station (Shawmut) so it's be very easy to travel to downtown Boston (20min), UMass Boston, MIT or Harvard Sq. (35min).",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/14d72586-b15a-4bf0-bd5e-93d2eda9e8da.jpg,6430732,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/6430732,Victoria/Tim,2013-05-16,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","We are musicians in Boston.

We're a young (very young) and fun loving couple currently living, working and enjoying this great city of Boston.  

We are both originally from the lone star state, but met and got married in Shanghai just before repatriating back to the U.S. It鈥檚 a very long story!  

We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle, and travel.  We are always thinking, planning and dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  And anywhere we travel, we usually seek out the latest culinary experience or seeking that perfectly balanced cocktail.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is truly an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and feel at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always! 

We are committed on making your stay with us an unforgettable EXPERIENCE!
 
We have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing in 2000 to continue with my professional career. 

We both had great experiences traveling in Asia, and we felt compelled to return back to the Americas and try to replicate the same adventures here at home.  

We really look forward to hosting you soon!

We're a young (very young) and fun loving couple currently living, working and enjoying this great city of Boston.  

We are both originally from the lone star state, but met and got married in Shanghai just before repatriating back to the U.S. It鈥檚 a very long story!  

We both love to eat, drink, host, mingle, and travel.  We are always thinking, planning and dreaming of new adventures close and afar.  And anywhere we travel, we usually seek out the latest culinary experience or seeking that perfectly balanced cocktail.

And right behind traveling, we both absolutely love to host!  We believe that hospitality is truly an acquired art form for making others feel welcome, comfortable, and feel at home.  We believe that it is the talent for spreading warmth and kindness that will be remembered always! 

We are committed on making your stay with us an unforgettable EXPERIENCE!
 
We have both lived abroad for a great part of our lives.  Nayeli spent time in Africa and went to school in France before moving to Asia.  I, on the other hand -  spent time in Europe before moving to Beijing in 2000 to continue with my professional career.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.

We can't wait to meet you and host you in Boston!

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels.

We are Boris and Susan - a young, professional couple living in Boston. 

I (Boris) is originally from Lithuania and Susan is from China - and we've been living in Boston for the last 6+ years.

I'm an entrepreneur and an avid traveler. My work focuses on startups and the transportation sector. In the past, I've been a part of the first person-to-person carsharing startup that helped people share their cars with neighbors (think Airbnb + Zipcar). After that, I have founded - and currently run - an electric bike company called EVELO that makes it easier for people to get around wherever they live. 

Susan works as a marketing professional at a larger company and is a huge photography buff. Many of the photos you'll see in our apartment are the ones done by her in our travels.

We both love to travel ourselves and try to stay at Airbnb wherever we go. Over the last few years, we've traveled together to Africa, Cuba, Iceland, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia - as much as possible we love to incorporate travel in our lifestyle.

We wanted to share our apartment with Airbnb guests as a way to pay back the incredibly hospitality and experiences we've encountered ourselves during our travels. We know what it's like to come to a new place for the first time and our goal is to provide you with a wonderful, cozy and unique place to stay and advice and feedback that you would expect from a friend.
